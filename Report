  ## EER Diagram        

<p align="justify"> The following Enhanced-Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERR) was created within MySQL Workbench, considering the distinctive attributes and interconnections inherent in each of the datasets associated with World country available data. This diagram shows the primary keys, serving as unique identifiers for records within each dataset, and the consequential establishment of corresponding foreign keys that underpin pivotal connections and associations between the datasets.

# Analytical Layer
## Data Warehouse
To create the analytical layer after loading all the tables from the Entity-Relationship Diagram (EER), it is essential to understand the primary keys in each table.This was crucial for determining the best way to link and join these tables efficiently enabling the extraction of valuable insights.
